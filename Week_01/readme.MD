# This is week 01 of my 90 days journey.
 So I know this was a very slow week for me at my situation but I will work more hard in the upcoming week.  
 So in this week all i did is python basic and company apply and gave 2 technical interview.-  
            One was mock interview and there I got to learn that I need to focus more on my SQL I forgot everything and then 
            second was wipro Elite role I think it went great she asked about my projects general technical terms and what is  happening around us. 
=========
So in the upcoming week I will focus on DSA basic and Numpy and pandas I will do again.
