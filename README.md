# This is my next 90 Days journal as I try to become a better developer and get a job in the tech field.
I know i am a little late but I am ready to commit all the hardwork into it.       
I will try to do the python , and relearn the HTML, CSS and JS and with all these I'll also try to do the AIML and DSA.
